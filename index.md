I hold a Bachelor's degree in Physics from the Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR), driven by my passion for science and technology. Transitioning into the tech and data market, I pursued a Master's degree in Electrical Engineering at UFPR, conducting my research at the CARISSMA Institute of Automated Driving in Germany under the supervision of Professors Eduardo Parente Ribeiro and Werner Hurber.
</p>

My research focused on creating a multimodal dataset for autonomous vehicles, consisting of real-world test track data and corresponding digital twins. Working with ROS (Robot Operating System), MATLAB, and Python, I developed expertise in data acquisition, manipulation, and transformation across various formats. I gained hands-on experience in Computer Vision, annotating dataset images using object detection algorithms like YOLO and OpenCV, and implementing genetic algorithms for supervised data projection.
My work also involved an analysis using semantic segmentation algorithms to assess the simulation-to-reality gap
