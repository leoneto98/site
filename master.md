I hold a master degree from the Federal University of Paran√° (UFPR), but the work was developed during my period in Germany in collaboration with the team of Professor [Werner Huber](https://www.thi.de/en/carissma/personnel/prof-dr-werner-huber/) in the [CARISSMA Institute of Automated Driving](https://www.thi.de/en/research/carissma/c-iad/).
